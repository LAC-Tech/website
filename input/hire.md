My speciality is capturing data across the supply chain. Often in 

The technical challenges of capturing data in remote environments, 

- a focus on facilitating the movement and tracking of goods
- data captured in the field
- the fringe of the supply chain, areas with poor connectivity

"I am a software developer with expertise in supply chain management and a focus on creating software solutions that facilitate the movement and tracking of goods and services. With additional experience in developing software for field use, I have worked with factory workers, maintenance workers, meat producers, and aid post workers to create custom solutions that streamline operations and improve efficiency. My background in supply chain logistics and field technology makes me uniquely equipped to solve the challenges associated with these areas.

Fond memories of this one.

### Web Development Agency

Company: Derp Technlogies (yes, that was really their name)
Where: New Zealand (Remote)
When: 2020

First time doing exclusively webdev, and first time I'd worked off any design more sophisticated than a wireframe mock-up.

Highlights include :

- replacing a paid for theme, and in the process replacing 7k lines of SASS with 1k lines of CSS and having it look exactly the same.

- introducing typescript to the codebase - first via jsdoc comments, and then finally a pretty trivial transformation at the end.


### Local Government Election Processing

Company: Election Services (New Zealand)
Where: Auckland, New Zealand
When: 2014-2015
Tech: C++, Qt, VB.NET

Aka my accidental year of C++ experience (bit of a confusion between 'C#' and 'C++' during the recruitment process, but everyone just went with it).

Big lesson I took away here was how unproductive C++ was for CRUD software. It was a Qt desktop app, and in hindsight I should have pushed for something like Python-Qt.

### Airport Maintenance Crew Software

Company: Novo-technical services
Where: New Zealand
When: 2014
Tech: F#, WinForms, Excel

My first time writing software professionally, and it had a huge impact on me.

Finally had my degree, but also had a truck-load of doubts if I could be effective in the real world.

Came in with no team, no supervisor, and no guidelines. And I knocked out of the park. It was a real confidence booster.

Note: I was full of functional fervour at the time, so I wrote it in F#. No one there even knew or cared what C# or F# was, they just wanted a desktop app.

## Employed

What / When / Where

### Livestock Product Manufacturer

Company: Allflex Livestock Intelligence

Where: New Zealand

When: 2016-2020

Tech: C#, ASP.NET, SQL Server, Dynamics GP (don't ask)

Biggest legacy system I'd worked on to date.

I learned the value of keeping a system running - our software went down, and two factories stopped functioning.

### Practice Management Software

Company: Gensolve
Where: New Zealand
When: 2014-2015
Tech: C#, Oracle Database

This was the first time I saw real life legacy software, and wow was it an eye opener.



They ended up closing the local office, and after a stint of remote work I was made redundant shortly after.
