# Objective

To work with smart, driven people on distributed systems that solve real world problems, reliably and quickly.

My career has centered on capturing and managing data across the supply chain. The challenges of doing this in the field - where connectivity cannot be assumed - has been an enduring motivation in my study of distributed systems.

- replacing a paid for theme, and in the process replacing 7k lines of SASS with 1k lines of CSS and having it look exactly the same.

- introducing typescript to the codebase - first via jsdoc comments, and then finally a pretty trivial transformation at the end.

My first time writing software professionally, and it had a huge impact on me.

Finally had my degree, but also had a truck-load of doubts if I could be effective in the real world.

Came in with no team, no supervisor, and no guidelines. And I knocked out of the park. It was a real confidence booster.

Note: I was full of functional fervour at the time, so I wrote it in F#. No one there even knew or cared what C# or F# was, they just wanted a desktop app.

## Employment History

### Livestock Product Manufacturer

<dl>
    <dt>Company</dt>
    <dd>Allflex Livestock Intelligence</dd>
    <dt>Where</dt>
    <dd>Palmerston North, New Zealand</dd>
    <dt>When</dt>
    <dd>2016-2020</dd>
    <dt>Tech</dt>
    <dd>C#, ASP.NET, SQL Server, Dyanmics GP (don't ask)</dd>
</dl>

Biggest legacy system I'd worked on to date.

I learned the value of keeping a system running - our software went down, and two factories stopped functioning.

Exposed to a vertical slice of the whole supply chain

### Practice Management Software

<dl>
    <dt>Company</dt>
    <dd>Gensolve</dd>
    <dt>Where</dt>
    <dd>Wellington, New Zealand</dd>
    <dt>When</dt>
    <dd>2014-2015 (Office closed)</dd>
    <dt>Tech</dt>
    <dd>C#, Oracle Database</dd>
</dl>

This was the first time I saw real life legacy software, and wow was it an eye opener.

They ended up closing the local office, and after a stint of remote work I was made red
shortly after.
