My speciality is capturing data across the supply chain. Often in remote or

The technical challenges of capturing data in remote environments, 

- a focus on facilitating the movement and tracking of goods
- data captured in the field
- the fringe of the supply chain, areas with poor connectivity

I am a software developer with expertise in supply chain management and a focus on creating software solutions that facilitate the movement and tracking of goods and services. With additional experience in developing software for field use, I have worked with factory workers, maintenance workers, meat producers, and aid post workers to create custom solutions that streamline operations and improve efficiency. My background in supply chain logistics and field technology makes me uniquely equipped to solve the challenges associated with these areas.

- introducing typescript to the codebase - first via jsdoc comments, and then finally a pretty trivial transformation at the end.

My first time writing software professionally, and it had a huge impact on me.

Finally had my degree, but also had a truck-load of doubts if I could be effective in the real world.

Came in with no team, no supervisor, and no guidelines. And I knocked out of the park. It was a real confidence booster.

Note: I was full of functional fervour at the time, so I wrote it in F#. No one there even knew or cared what C# or F# was, they just wanted a desktop app.

Biggest legacy system I'd worked on to date.

I learned the value of keeping a system running - our software went down, and two factories stopped functioning.

Exposed to a vertical slice of the whole supply chain

### Practice Management Software

</dl>

This was the first time I saw real life legacy software, and wow was it an eye opener.

They ended up closing the local office, and after a stint of remote work I was made redundant shortly after.
