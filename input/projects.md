## Sync about it

[Try online](/sync.html)

[Source Code](https://github.com/LAC-Tech/website/blob/master/www/crdt.js)

Sync contains my implementations of CRDTs from the following papers:

- "A comprehensive study of convergent and commutative replicated data types" (Marc Shapiro, Nuno Preguiça, Carlos Baquero, and Marek Zawirski)
- "An optimized conflict-free replicated set." (Annette Bieniusa, Marek Zawirski, Nuno Preguiça, Marc Shapiro, Carlos Baquero, Valter Balegas, and Sérgio Duarte)

All CRDTs implemented show their internal state, and have all been extensively tested for associativity, commutativity and idempotence using property based testing.
