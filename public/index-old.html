    	<h1>Considering a Web App Rewrite?</h1>

<p>Maybe it uses older tech. </p>

<p>Maybe your devs don’t want to touch it. </p>

<p>Maybe you’re hoping all or some of it can be salvaged. </p>

<p>Regardless, a rewrite can be one of the most expensive and time consuming things your company will ever do. </p>

<h2>You owe it to yourself to get a second opinion.</h2>

<p>I offer an independent, fixed price service. I assess your current solution, engage with your team, and present you with the best options going forward. </p>

<p>This takes place over a 2-4 week period, after which you’ll be in a much better position to proceed. Or not, as the case may be.</p>

<h2>When it comes to rewrites I’ve seen it all.</h2>

<p>Before, after, during.</p>

<p>The good, the bad and the ugly.</p>

<p>Your codebase will not scare me. It will not affect me emotionally. My advice is impartial and based on pragmatic criteria, not which tech stack I want on my resume.</p>

<h2>Run it by me for free</h2>

<p><a href="mailto:info@lewiscampbell.tech">Tell me</a> why you’re thinking of re-writing, what you hope it will solve, and what you foresee going wrong. </p>

<p>I’ll give you an initial 30 minute consultation for free. The rest is up to you.</p>
