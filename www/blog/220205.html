    	<p>It was May, 2021. I was living on a farm in rural New Zealand (total ag-tech immersion). It was beautiful, even the internet was decent... until this scoundrel chewed through the cable connecting me to the satellite dish.</p>

<p>I was now offline.</p>

<h2>Agricultural Web Users</h2>

<p>A lot of people have connectivity issues in rural areas - and thanks to this ravenous ram I became one of them. Sure they&#39;ll have internet at the farmhouse, and it may even be decent. But many areas have no effective mobile coverage at all - once you&#39;re outside the range of the WiFi router it&#39;s game over. (I was half an hours drive from 2G mobile internet when this happened).</p>

<p>So if you&#39;re in ag your customers may be offline, online, or in that insidious packet-dropping border region in-between. This is not something mainstream web dev really considers - and fair enough. Most software is written by people in air-conditioned offices for other people in air-conditioned offices. If you have ubiquitous fast internet and 4G mobile as a backup, these edge cases don&#39;t merit much attention.</p>

<p>But agriculture is different. For one thing, your typical &quot;modern&quot; SPA with multiple megabytes of ECMAScript is going to take an eternity to load (if it even does). Hitting API end points returning mountains of JSON with <code>very_descriptive_field_names</code> makes matters worse. And as for third party tracking scripts - there&#39;s going to be nothing to track as your users give up in frustration.</p>

<h2>Designing around Limited Bandwidths</h2>

<p>So, what&#39;s the solution?</p>

<p>With slow connections, recognise you&#39;re in a <strong>constrained environment</strong>. You can&#39;t use all your favourite front-end toys, or send data for the hell of it. <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/">Bundlephobia</a> is your new best friend, as is the network throttle in dev tools. Your app needs to be lean and mean - which means so does your <code>package.json</code> (if it even makes sense to have one).</p>

<p>That covers bad connections - but what about no connections?  For read-only apps, service workers will solve a lot of your problems. But if your customers are inputting data - welcome to the world of conflicts. If your app instances are writing data independently from each other, then you&#39;re writing a distributed system.</p>

<p>In this case, the most important thing is to <strong>accept that conflicts will happen</strong>, and you have to deal with them. A lot of software claims to &quot;solve&quot; this problem for you. The solution is usually last-write wins - which customers tend to interpret as &quot;randomly losing my data&quot;. So make sure your software is aware of conflicts, and can either resolve them automatically (i.e, CRDTs) or surface them to the user.</p>
