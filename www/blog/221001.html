    	<p>So you&#39;re in charge of a software product, but you don&#39;t understand software?</p>

<p>That&#39;s fine. I&#39;m in charge of my bank account and I don&#39;t understand international finance.</p>

<p>So, here&#39;s a car analogy.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img alt="Wrecked Vintage Car" src="/img/Wrecked Car.jpeg">
</div>

<p>Imagine your car runs fine, but it&#39;s having trouble starting. You apply the typical software maintenance strategy:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You ignore it. Damn warning light, my customers are waiting for me!</p></li>
<li><p>Eventually it refuses to start. You now have to jump start it every time. This gets really annoying, especially when you&#39;re parked outside in the rain.</p></li>
<li><p>One day (typically a weekend) the battery explodes in your face. Your car is now a &quot;legacy&quot; car.</p></li>
<li><p>In a panic, you buy another car. A slick man in a tacky suit sells you one with a much nicer infotainment system - however you soon discover it doesn&#39;t have enough seats (cars are complicated). So you pay the hefty repair bill to get the old one working again.</p></li>
<li><p>You are now maintaining two cars.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here&#39;s the kicker. You probably could&#39;ve pulled over, taken the car into a shop, and had a new battery installed for a fraction of the cost.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you wish you&#39;d done that at step 1?</p>
