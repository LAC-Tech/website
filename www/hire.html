<p>My speciality is capturing data across the supply chain. Often in</p>
<p>The technical challenges of capturing data in remote
environments,</p>
<ul>
<li>a focus on facilitating the movement and tracking of goods</li>
<li>data captured in the field</li>
<li>the fringe of the supply chain, areas with poor connectivity</li>
</ul>
<p>“I am a software developer with expertise in supply chain management
and a focus on creating software solutions that facilitate the movement
and tracking of goods and services. With additional experience in
developing software for field use, I have worked with factory workers,
maintenance workers, meat producers, and aid post workers to create
custom solutions that streamline operations and improve efficiency. My
background in supply chain logistics and field technology makes me
uniquely equipped to solve the challenges associated with these
areas.</p>

<p>Fond memories of this one.</p>
<h3 id="web-development-agency">Web Development Agency</h3>
<p>Company: Derp Technlogies (yes, that was really their name) Where:
New Zealand (Remote) When: 2020</p>
<p>First time doing exclusively webdev, and first time I’d worked off
any design more sophisticated than a wireframe mock-up.</p>
<p>Highlights include :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>replacing a paid for theme, and in the process replacing 7k lines
of SASS with 1k lines of CSS and having it look exactly the
same.</p></li>
<li><p>introducing typescript to the codebase - first via jsdoc
comments, and then finally a pretty trivial transformation at the
end.</p></li>

<p>Company: Election Services (New Zealand) Where: Auckland, New Zealand
When: 2014-2015 Tech: C++, Qt, VB.NET</p>
<p>Aka my accidental year of C++ experience (bit of a confusion between
‘C#’ and ‘C++’ during the recruitment process, but everyone just went
with it).</p>
<p>Big lesson I took away here was how unproductive C++ was for CRUD
software. It was a Qt desktop app, and in hindsight I should have pushed
for something like Python-Qt.</p>
<h3 id="airport-maintenance-crew-software">Airport Maintenance Crew
Software</h3>
<p>Company: Novo-technical services Where: New Zealand When: 2014 Tech:
F#, WinForms, Excel</p>
<p>My first time writing software professionally, and it had a huge
impact on me.</p>
<p>Finally had my degree, but also had a truck-load of doubts if I could
be effective in the real world.</p>
<p>Came in with no team, no supervisor, and no guidelines. And I knocked
out of the park. It was a real confidence booster.</p>
<p>Note: I was full of functional fervour at the time, so I wrote it in
F#. No one there even knew or cared what C# or F# was, they just wanted
a desktop app.</p>

2016-2020 Tech: C#, ASP.NET, SQL Server, Dynamics GP (don’t ask)</p>
<p>Biggest legacy system I’d worked on to date.</p>
<p>I learned the value of keeping a system running - our software went
down, and two factories stopped functioning.</p>

<p>Company: Gensolve Where: New Zealand When: 2014-2015 Tech: C#, Oracle

<p>This was the first time I saw real life legacy software, and wow was
it an eye opener.</p>
<p>They ended up closing the local office, and after a stint of remote
work I was made redundant shortly after.</p>
