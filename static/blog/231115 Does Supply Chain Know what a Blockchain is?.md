The more I read of what supplychain says of blockchain, the less I think they understand it.

## The Core of Blockchain

First off, I will explain - as briefly as I can - the core of what blockchain is. There's blocks - which are just pieces of data. They are are linked together. If these blocks are not modified, deleted, or otherwise tampered with after they're linked, one can then verify every link from the first block to the last - hence 'chain'. If any of the blocks were to be altered after the fact, the link which pointed to it would not work. And so the chain would be broken.

Think of a web page that has a link back to the previous page. If that previous page changes, the link becomes invalid.

And that is the core of what blockchain is what a block chain is. The blocks can hold any data. The links between them can represent anything. And the blockchain itself can be stored - and copied - anywhere. However writing from the supply chain world embellish this core - as we shall see.

## Blockchain according to HBR

From the article ''

*"When blockchain record keeping is used, assets such as units of inventory, orders, loans, and bills of lading are given unique identifiers, which serve as digital tokens (similar to bitcoins). Additionally, participants in the blockchain are given unique identifiers, or digital signatures, which they use to sign the blocks they add to the blockchain. Every step of the transaction is then recorded on the blockchain as a transfer of the corresponding token from one participant to another."*

There's nothing in blockchain that will inherently provide any of these benefits. Everything they have listed - unique identifiers, digital signatures, recording every step of the transaction - is possible - and much faster - with regular databases.

## Blockchain according to Planet Tracker

Let's move on to this from Planet tracker, which describes itself as "a non-profit financial think thank". To their credit, they have a much more restrained description:

*"Blockchain databases are similar to traditional traceability databases; however, they create a decentralized, peer-to-peer network that connects all the stakeholders in a textile value chain â€“ from farmers, designing houses, raw material suppliers, manufacturers, transporter, distributors, retail outlets to consumers."*

Planet Tracker at least sounds like it's on Planet Earth, but still lauds things that have nothing to do with block chain.

There's no reason that a non-blockchain database cannot create a "decentralized, peer-to-peer network". Nothing inherent in blockchain will help you create a "decentralized, peer-to-peer network". That's not to say there aren't solutions utilising block chain that won't help you do this - there are - but blockchain has zero to do with it.

## Blockchain according to Deloitte

Departing planet tracker on planet earth, we move onto Deloitte, one of the big four accounting firms. And I quote:

*Imagine a world where you can replace the currently fragmented tracking of your supply chain with an interoperable solution, one that can significantly reduce the risk of unethical sourcing, shipping delays, inadequate storage, or ineffective distribution of your goods. Imagine a world where you can provide visibility into your supply chain to your customers and regulators and furnish irrefutable proof that you are meeting supply chain standards and expectations. And imagine a world, where, by addressing these considerations, you foster deeper trust and efficiency among all the stakeholders within your supply chain.*

I have no idea how people read this stuff. Trying to extract useful information out of this was like trying to climb a wall made of glass. Needless to say, it has almost nothing to do with blockchain.

## Reddit post

But from a fact-finding technique so effective wikipedia had to outlaw it - original research. Here's some responses from the supply chain subreddit when I broached the topic.

Disclaimer - if you recognise your comments here, I'm not trying to belittle you. God knows I've been wrong on the internet before. I don't know what the hell a "Fifth Party Logistics Provider" is, or even how many dimensions exists in logistics provider space.


I'm in software, and I've worked on quite a few traceability systems. 

I'm a tech guy that's always been a bit confused about all the hype blockchain gets in supply chain. 90% of the time articles talking about it mention benefits like:

enhancing traceability

recording transactions between parties in one place

pinpointing the sources of execution errors

...our ERP systems are shit!

None of which require a blockchain to fix. And many of which no technology in this universe can fix because they are business process issues.

The cynic in me says that the only reason blockchain gets hype is because it's the only alternative to emailing spreadsheets to each other that this industry has ever heard of.

Am I missing something? Is trust so low between different parts of the supply chain that you need a public, shared, tamper proof, awkward and incredibly slow ledger?

Or is the industry just behind in digitisation and needs a better way to share data other than PDF scans of manifests, and this 'blockchain' thing sounds good so let's try that?
