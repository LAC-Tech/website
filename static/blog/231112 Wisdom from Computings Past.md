> I don't think computing is a real field. It acts like a pop culture, it deals in fads, and it doesn't even know its own roots. And worse than that it does not know about the really good things that were done in the past.

Real field or not, computing is young. The world's first computer science qualification began in 1953 at Cambridge. The United States had not a single Computer Science department until the 1960's. We like to talk of 'Engineering', but Chemical Engineering was alchemy in an earlier life, and I believe our field is no different.

For the most part, we have but two reactions to the past. Either we love the retro aesthetic; admiring the machines of an earlier age, and feeling a nostalgia for the tech of our youth. Or we sneer at it; looking down on people with primitive hardware who "don't know what we do now". Almost never do we think that they might "know what we have now forgotten", and that there might be wisdom therein, still of use to us now.

In episode one we see the story of Phyllis, an elderly lady who is using a home computer to track business data in her shop. Phyllis - who might well have been born during WWI - has started up a 'computer service' to help other businesses do what she's done. "I find the computer business much more exciting" she says with a smile.

Treat with the past honestly, to set aside what is no longer needed, and to recall what is good but forgotten.
