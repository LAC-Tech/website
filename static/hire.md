## What I can do

If you:

- are struggling to capture data in remote or field locations
- need to build connective tissue between your system and an external one
- have "messy data" that you want to derive value from 

I can probably help.

## What I'm looking for

I'm primarily looking for contract roles.

Any timezone touching the Pacific Ocean is easy for me to work with.


## What I've done

- Tech Lead at a food traceability company, for products deployed in Canada &
  Australia.
- Software Evaluation for remote medical logistics in Papua New Guinea.
- Deputy head of IT for animal traceability company across Australia and
  New Zealand factories & logistics centers.
