# Lewis Campbell Tech

Welcome to my web site.

I'm a solo software consultant - mainly working in supply chain traceability.

My technical interest is partition-tolerant distributed systems - especially databases that can function when disconnected, and sync later. Big proponent of CRDTs, offline-first and local-first. Recently I've been getting into systems programming and data storage.

I live surrounded by farms in the middle of nowhere in New Zealand with my wife and daughter.
