Welcome to my web site.

I'm a solo software consultant - mainly working in supply chain traceability.

My technical interests are in partition-tolerant distributed systems - especially databases that can function under adverse network conditions. I'm a big proponent of CRDTs, event sourcing, and local-first. Recently I've been getting into systems programming and data storage.

If you're interested in bringing me in as a consultant, please [contact](/contact.html) me using the link provided.
